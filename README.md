## Installation and Requirements
Using Python 3.11 and 'pip install -m requirements.txt' to get all required packages to run.

## Usage
To run the code, simply open your command prompt(cmd), powershell or vscode terminal window and type "python main.py" or use the path to both the python.exe and the main.py file. That would look something like this:    

'c:/Users/Daniel/Documents/GitHub/Challenge-Data/.challenge_data_env/Scripts/python.exe c:/Users/Daniel/Documents/GitHub/Challenge-Data/main.py'   
   
To correctly run the data-collection program, you need to specify a number between 1 - 333(333 is the maximum value the website we use to scrape from can handle for page numbers). This will provide slightly less than 20.000 scraped listings.

## Timeline
Project 1(out of 4) was started on the 26th of June 2023, and completed on 30/06/2023.

## About
This is the first out of a four part study project to make a working data model that analyses the current Belgian housing market, and is able to predict House- and Apartment pricing accurately. Our dataset uses +10.000 listings.
